			<dt>Music and Playlist Management</dt>
			<hr>
				<p>NightWatch allows users to create and manage music playlists to play through the Discord
					application. Users can create queues of songs from a number of sources: Youtube, Spotify, or
					Soundcloud. The bot plays music by simply following the hyperlink provided to it by the user. This allows for
					multiple sources of music to play with no conflicts, including Youtube, Spotify, Soundcloud, etc.</p>
				<p1>The commands associated with playlist management are:</p1>
				<dd>queue - adds the song at the link to the queue (if there is no queue the song begins immediately)</dd>
				<dd>next - skips to the next song in the queue</dd>
				<dd>back - plays the previous song in the queue</dd>
				<dd>clear - clears the queue</dd>
				<dd>pause - pauses the queue</dd>
				<dd>resume - resumes the queue</dd>
			<dt>Miscellaneous Commands</dt>
			<hr>
				<p>There are a number of other commands that will be implemented in NightWatch, with more
					being optionally added as development continues.</p> 
				<p1>Alphabetically, these commands are listed below:</p1>
				<dd>echo - echoes back the statement to the user</dd>
				<dd>embed - builds a rich embed based on the RichEmbed Discord API</dd>
				<dd>help - returns a list of the commands currently available to the user</dd>
